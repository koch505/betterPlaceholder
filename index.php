				<h1>Solo Conference Update</h1>
				<p>The Solo mission was to curate an affordable, world-class conference for freelancers. This was born from my own positive experiences with design conferences and freelance communities, and also negative experiences of being priced out of events targeting corporate training budgets.</p>
				<p>Though met with overwhelming interest from freelancers and community partners, I was unable to secure financial sponsorship in the months leading up to the ticket announcement. Believing strongly in the mission, I decided to pay for early expenses myself until ticket sales could sustain the costs.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, those sales are being outpaced by prohibitively large bills such as venue deposits and speaker flights. The responsible decision is to call off the event and give as much notice as possible to the speakers, attendees, and venue.</p>
				<p>I want to give a big thank-you to the speakers, partners, everyone who lent their time to a meeting, call, or email, everyone who helped with feedback or promotion, and especially everyone who bought a ticket. The support I received was incredible.</p>
				<p>All purchases will be refunded in full plus 10% over the next 24 hours. As for me, Iâ€™ll continue to run the <a href="https://meetup.com/londonfreelancers/">London Freelancers meetup</a> and design and code full-time for clients.</p>
				<p>Sincerely,</p>
